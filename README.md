# They call me blocky!

They call me blocky. Since I can remember I have been blocky, I don't quite know why I'm here, all I know is that I must follow their instructions otherwise the lights go out and it becomes cold and silent. The tests are easy and it's just rinse and repeat. Nothing too bad!

Although sometimes I have a moment of clarity and think why am I doing this and suddenly everything becomes so weird like I've just recaptured my "life" for lack of a better word.

They call me blocky! Is a simple game where you are in trial chambers and you complete very simple tasks to help ensure you are active so we don't lose you in the mess. Play the game and find out about the story and have a good time while doing so!

## How to beat each level

You can either follow the below tutorial or watch this youtube video I uploaded to my channel:

### Level 1

Beating level 1 is very simple, just walk through the door and wait for the button to move down and press it with your character's weight

### Level 2

Beating level 2 require (in no order) to flip all the levers to activate them. The levers, like anything else in the game, can be flipped by entering the lever and pressing 'E' after that a door will rise and you can enter that.

### Level 3

Level 3 is very simple and requires that you just press each button for the door to open, the first button is a pressure plate that can be charged by sitting on it for a little bit, after that you can press the red button on the left to show the next pressure plate which will show the final button.

### Level4 

Level 4's physics are really bad (yes there is a reason for that) and you have to be really finiky with it, you have to back and forth some objects quite a lot to get them out of their holders. 

Ball one (that spawns next to you) should go into the little thing right next it which will drop another second smaller ball from above which you can move to press the button that you can't reach.

After that you have to get that small ball in the small ball holder (past the square block) which you can then use to activate the button with the block, the player cannot activate with their body.

After that get the first ball again and move it into the final ball holder which will release the big final ball and you need to move that all the way to the right to press the big button which will reveal the door that you can enter to go to the next level.

### Level 5

Level 5 is simple as long as you understand the paintings enough. The paintings show every lever as they are invisible. The locations of the levers are as follows:

There is a lever to the left of the door that you must press before continuing otherwise you have to restart the level (you can see it in the painting on the floor).

There is another lever on the platform to the left of the painting that will open the door. Once flipped you can go through the door and there will be an invisible lever right infront of the closed door.

The next lever is to the left of the top of the moving platform that is going up, you have to jump off and go a little to the left to flip it.

Another lever is getting pointed at. After flipping that if you didn't miss any you can have the door open.

To know if you flipped a lever, listen out for the click sound effect.

### Level 6

Level 6 is the final and biggest level. To beat this you just have to follow what you can see

#### 6.0

Using the painting you can find out where the invisible button is, inverse gravity by jumping to press the button, another button should appear and you can press that to have another button which will show a painting to where the hidden lever is. After pressing the lever continue to the next room

#### 6.2

6.2 requires you to flip all the levers in the correct order, when you flip the third one a button will apppear on the left-most side of the room, when you press it, the door will open, a very simple level.

#### 6.4 

6.4 requires you to re-flip the lever in level 6.2 and then flip the rest of the levers in the 6.4 room, the first lever has to be flipped by jumping on the trampoline and using some skill too hit it, after that gravity should inverse and you can click the final lever, after flipping them the pressure plate will open up, sit on it for a little bit so it can charge and then race for the door!

#### 6.6

Level 6.6 requires you to look at the painting and flip the lever that is invisible on the right side of the trampoline, once flipped the black box in the top right of the room will reaveal itself, you can press that and then the block will drop, allowing you to press the red button with it, once you press the red button a few more paintings will reveal themselves which show levers in level 6.0 and 6.2, using what you can see in the painting you can figure out where the levers are and flip them, once you do that you go back to the room and contine on to the final room

#### 6.8 

This is really simple, you walk in and the door appears, a blockage will stop you from going through so you just have to go back to 6.6 and then simply walk back to 6.8, by walking through the blue lasers it will give you flexible gravity so you can jump to invert gravity and reach the final door to beat the game!

# YOU DID IT!

Congrats on beating the game, now you must find all the hidden secrets that the game has to offer.
