# They call me blocky!

They call me blocky. Since I can remember I have been blocky, I don't quite know why I'm here, all I know is that I must follow their instructions otherwise the lights go out and it becomes cold and silent. The tests are easy and it's just rinse and repeat. Nothing too bad!

Although sometimes I have a moment of clarity and think why am I doing this and suddenly everything becomes so weird like I've just recaptured my "life" for lack of a better word.

They call me blocky! Is a simple game where you are in trial chambers and you complete very simple tasks to help ensure you are active so we don't lose you in the mess. Play the game and find out about the story and have a good time while doing so!
